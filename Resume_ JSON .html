To detect and forecast the number of people. We need software and hardware with computational capacity this work suggest the implementation of SSD and MOBILENET architecture to detect people and ARIMA model to forecast the number of people visiting the region of interest we have suggested a system with low computational power system. It is also observed that the proposed system requires less computational power than the typical software core system. "
