DIFF B/W HTTP 1.0 and 2.0:


HTTP 1.0:
	1. It can initiate only single request per TCP connection.

	2.It is textual protocols, it consume more bandwidth and more error prone. 
	when compare to HTTP 2.0 it is very slow protocol. 

	3. It doesn't have header compression.

	4. HTTP 1.0 it takes more time to load page.

	5. HTTP 1.0 support only  GET, HEAD, PUT, and POST.

HTTP 2.0:
 	1. It is binary protocal,consume less bandwidth, are more efficiently parsed and are less error-prone.
	it handle elements such as whitespace, capitalization and line endings.

	2. it can initiate multiple requests in parallel over a single TCP connection. 
         As a result, web pages containing several elements are delivered over one TCP connection.
	
	3. HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce the overhead caused by TCP’s slow-start mechanism.
	
	4.HTTP/2 servers push likely-to-be-used resources into a browser’s cache, even before they’re requested. 
	This allows browsers to display content without additional request cycles.

	5. Web browsers only support HTTP/2 via encrypted connections, increasing user and application security.
