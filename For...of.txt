For...of :

	It creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects, TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables.

Example :
1.

const array1 = ['FAYEZ', 'KALAM', 'ARSATH'];

for (const element of array1) {
  console.log(element);
}

Output: 
"FAYEZ"
"KALAM"
"ARSATH"

2.
const iterable = [10, 20, 30];

for (let value of iterable) {
  value += 1;
  console.log(value);
}
Output:
 11
 21
 31

DIFF B/W For...in and For...of:

Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over something.The main difference between them is what they iterate over.

	1.The for...in statement iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in an arbitrary order.

        2.The for...of statement iterates over values that the iterable object defines to be iterated over.
