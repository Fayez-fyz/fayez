Difference between Statically typed and dynamically typed languages

Statically Typed Language;
   
	1. The type of variable known at compile time.
	2. we can caught bugs very earlier because of all kinds of the things done by compailer.  
	3. types are not allowed to change.
  	Eg:JAVA, C , C++

code example:
	String str = "Hello";  //variable str statically typed as string
	str = 5;               //would throw an error since str is supposed to be a string only


Dynamically typed language;

	1.type checking at run-time as opposed to compile-time.
	2.it will save time to code.you can program quicker.
	3.but it may come bugs lot beacause of type checking at run time.
	4.types are allowed to change.
	Eg: Python,Javascrip,Php etc

code example:
	str = "Hello" # variable str is linked to a string value
	str = 5       # now it is linked to an integer value; perfectly OK
