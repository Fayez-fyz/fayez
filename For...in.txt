For...in

	It iterates over all enumerable properties of an object that are keyed by strings.

Example:

const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

for (const property in object) {
  console.log(`${property}: ${object[property]}`);
}

 output:
 "a: 1"
 "b: 2"
 "c: 3"


DIFF B/W For...in and For...of:

Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over something.The main difference between them is what they iterate over.

	1.The for...in statement iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in an arbitrary order.

        2.The for...of statement iterates over values that the iterable object defines to be iterated over.
